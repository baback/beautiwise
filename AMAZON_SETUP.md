## 🎯 Product Matching Logic

The system currently matches products based on:

### Skin Types → Product Categories:
- **Oily** → Oil control cleansers, mattifying moisturizers, salicylic acid
- **Dry** → Hydrating cleansers, moisturizing creams, hyaluronic acid
- **Combination** → Gentle cleansers, lightweight moisturizers, niacinamide
- **Sensitive** → Gentle cleansers, fragrance-free products
- **Normal** → Daily cleansers, daily moisturizers, vitamin C serums

### Concerns → Active Ingredients:
- **Acne** → Benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid treatments
- **Fine lines** → Retinol serums, anti-aging creams
- **Dark spots** → Vitamin C serums, brightening treatments
- **Large pores** → Niacinamide serums, BHA exfoliants
- **Dullness** → Exfoliating serums, brightening masks
- **Redness** → Calming serums, centella asiatica

### Budget Filtering:
- **Under $25** → Products under $25
- **$25-50** → Products $25-50
- **$50-100** → Products $50-100
- **$100+** → Premium products over $100

## 🔄 When You Get Real API Access

### Replace Mock Data:
The `makeAmazonAPICall()` method in `amazon-api.js` is ready for real API integration. Just uncomment and configure the actual API call code.

### Add Request Signing:
Amazon requires signed requests. You'll need to implement AWS Signature Version 4 or use a library like `aws4` for Node.js.

### Product Cards Include:
- ✅ Product images
- ✅ Prices with pink badges
